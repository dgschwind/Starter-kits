This is a starter kit for a Spring Boot application that uses Spring Security
for end user Authentication as well as JPA. The JPA provider is EclipseLink.

Here are the steps I followed.

1) Install Java 1.8.0_181 and maven 3.0.5
2) Use Spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io) to generate the initial maven and Java project using Spring Boot 2.0.5, choosing Web and Security as the selected dependencies.
